<h1>HORUS (Human-readable Owl-art Reasoner Unit System)</h1>
 
<p>This reasoner  is based on  the  <b>OWL ART API</b> (<a href="http://art.uniroma2.it/owlart/">http://art.uniroma2.it/owlart/ </a>), developed from the ART Research Group at the University of Rome Tor Vergata (<a href="http://art.uniroma2.it/">http://art.uniroma2.it/</a>). These API offer an abstraction layer over different RDF triple store technologies so make the reasoner usable with all knowledge representation languages ( defined by the world web consortium) used to write ontologies.<br><p>This reasoner can be used as stand-alone application and as Semantic Turkey extension</p>
<h2>Reasoner as an Semantic Turkey extension</h2>
<p> Semantic Turkey (<a href="http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it/">http://semanticturkey.uniroma2.it/</a>) is a platform for Semantic Bookmarking and Ontology Development realized by the ART Research Group at the University of Rome, Tor Vergata. 
Moreover, this platform, provide to user an ontologies editor. The part of the Reasoner, that extends the Semantic Tukey platform, is inserted into the ontologies editor  and providing a reasoning operation into the ontology loaded in the platform </p>
<h2>Reasoner as an stand-alone application</h2>
<p>The reasoner can be used as stand-alone application: with a comfortable graphic user interface is possible to apply the reasoning process on ontology loaded from the user.</p>
<h2>Reasoner features</h2>
<p> The reasoner has the following features: 
<ul>
 <li> Possibility to specify configuration parameters for the reasoning operation</li>
 <li> Possibility to specify  custom inference rules </li>
 <li> Possibility to show how have been generated the new inferred triples  </li>
 </ul>
The user can customize the reasoning operation. He can choose how many times to perform the operation of reasoning with the same configuration parameters and same inference rules. 
Moreover, can be specify which inference rules execute during the reasoning operation and  decide if the visualization of how have been generated the new information, must be product.<br>
The user can write a custom inference rules with a natural and human-readable language.  He can submit these rules to the reasoner before the start of the operation of reasoning.
During the drafting of the rules, user must put the focus on the structure of the inference rules: rules follow a predetermined structure.<br>The reasoner provides the user a confortable visualization of the new information produced during  the reasonig operation. There are two type of visualization: one textual
and one with a graph form. From these visualizations the user can watch the full history of new informations, filter the informations according to the name of the rules by which they were generated and search a single piece of information has been produced. 

For all other informations, take a look to wiki pages.
